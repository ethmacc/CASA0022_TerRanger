# CASA0022 TerRanger
1. [Introduction](#Introduction)
This repository contains the code and 3D models required to build to TerRanger Smart Walking Stick, my dissertation project for the MSc Connected Environments course. The TerRanger system consists of 2 key components: the smart walking stick device and a mobile application that pairs with it using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). TerRanger uses two STMicroelectronics VL53L5CX tiny LiDAR sensors to map out the terrain below the hiking stick. This data is then translated into point-cloud form and visualized on the mobile application.
